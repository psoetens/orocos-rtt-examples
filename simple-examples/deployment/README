This example contains two components, taken from the Deployment
Component manual example. Each component is compiled into a shared
library. This example requires the OCL deployer application and the
reporting component.

1. Use 'make' to compile. (or: make OROPATH=/path/to/orocos)

2. Start the deployer application:
$ deployer-gnulinux -l info

3. The TaskBrowser appears, now load the configuration from the XML
  file: loadComponents("example.cpf")

4. Configure the components using the XML specifications:
  configureComponents()

5. start the components:
  startComponents()

OR use kickStart("example.cpf") in step 3. to load, configure and
start this example.

The Controller will make the Plant component describe a sine shaped
trajectory.  The reporting trace can be found in results.txt.
